## Overview  
This project is a simple, interactive solar system model built using **HTML** and **CSS**.

## Getting Started
You'll have to firstly fork and clone the repo. Make sure you have the G++ compiler installed. Then, choose the program you want to run and compile it:
```
g++ -o <output_file_name> <name_of_files(s)_you_want_to_run>
```
Once successfully compiled, you can execute the output file using:
```
./<output_file_name>
```  

## Future Improvements  
- Add JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., click to view planet details).  
- Improve accuracy of planetary orbits.   
- Images for planets and scaling sizes to actual.
